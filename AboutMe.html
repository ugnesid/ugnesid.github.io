                    <h4>Interests</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">My biggest, oldest and longest passion is traveling. I should thank my parents for
                        providing me with the opportunity to travel at an early age and to fall in love with it.
                        I have two lifetime goals related to traveling. First, I would have traveled to as many
                        countries as how old I am (now I am almost on the edge - I am 32 years old and I have
                        been in 32 countries.) Second one is to see all the new 7 wonders of the world through
                        life (3 left at this point).
                        <br/>
                        My newest interest is programming. I still can’t believe that it embraced me so
                        strongly. I wish to dive into the developing world, but I try not to sink at this point
                        in my life. What a wide world exists behind the screens of our smart devices!!
                        I built this page to learn and practice all that cool things like HTML, CSS and
                        JavaScrip.
                        <br/>
                        My survival passion - coffee! I love to go to cafes to have coffee and to observe the
                        surroundings or to learn to program.

                    <h4>Life</h4>
                        <p class="text-align">I am Lithuanian and life brought me to the United States. My husband and I have lived in Utah since 2021. We are staying temporarily here so we want to travel around as much as we can. Before that, I lived all my life in Lithuania. Greece, Denmark and the US are countries in which I lived for around 3 months each during my studies. Those months still are most memorable, they raised me as a person, taught me real life and showed me different lifestyles. 
                        <br/>
                        As life goes on, travels and jobs change each other, I met the love of my life, and after four years of friendship we became husband and wife in 2020. Only after one year, I gave birth to our beautiful daughter who changed our lifestyle. Surprise surprise (at least for me) we didn't stop traveling. Of course it became more demanding, but we already have some unforgettable experiences. Travelling grows the three of us in the most amazing and unexpected ways.

                    <h4>Career</h4>
                        <p class="text-align"> I have a bachelor and master degrees in Public Health Management, but have never worked in my education area. I was fascinated by working in the field of HR, so step by step I became a Human Resources specialist. 
                        <br/>
                        Currently, I’m working at an information technology company as a Human Resource Manager. We are developing unbreakable wired and wireless connectivity products. Most specifically, I am responsible for having employees in the company, that they and the company would be fully satisfied with their work. My daily work life is dynamic, kind of stressful but also interesting, because I work and meet so many amazingly smart people.
                        I have the most experience in the recruitment process and Labor law. The rights of employees are as important as the rules of the company so I try to ensure the well-being of both sides.
