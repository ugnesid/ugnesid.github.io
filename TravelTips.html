        <li>Breastfeeding. I was only breastfeeding my baby and that was the best thing while traveling. Not the best thing for benefits for the baby, but benefits for me. I only need to have myself so that the baby would be full. Also, breastfeeding babies fall to sleep very fast and easily.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Outfits. Dress the baby and yourself in comfortable layers. It is often changing temperature in the plane, you will need to undress or dress up the baby at least a few times during flight. If you need to fully change the baby clothes, it is not convenient to do it on the plane (changing diapers is inconvenient too) so comfortable clothes don't make it any more difficult. Also think about what outfit is most comfortable and easily adaptable to changing temperatures. At least I am under sweat most of the time with my baby.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Bring double or triple the baby necessities (diapers, wet wipes, clothes, snacks). Your flight can be delayed or your baby would poop more than usual. Probably you would use a big part of them, but at least you will be calm that you are preferred for every situation.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Books and toys. Bring a few favorite toys and books and a few new ones to keep things interesting while you're flying with your baby.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Schedule. When we are traveling, focusing on only the present moment really helps. Avoid worrying about if it’s time for a meal or a nap. Feed the baby when he seems hungry. Let the baby sleep when he passes out. Things are frequently so new and exciting, the baby will very likely go longer than usual between meals and naps and without acting bothered.</li>
        <br/>
        <li>Mantra for yourself. You need to have some phrase in your mind that you could tell yourself if the baby would not be calm and scream all over the plane. Mine was: “everything is ok, I will never meet these people again”.</li>

    <h2>8 Tips For Traveling With Baby By Car</h2>
    <p class="contentp1">Do not travel with a baby in a car unless your other choice is to sit at home and go crazy. I had this amazing (from the crazy side) experience, because my husband and I wanted to explore Utah as much as we could while we had only two years in the US. 
        My sincere advice is to travel with the car at least when your toddler can talk and express himself not only by screaming, falling or crying. Anyway if you want to experience the driving with baby that are my tips:
    </p>
    <div class="flightgrid">
    <img class="imgcar" src="./photos/car2.jpg"/>
    <img class="imgcar" src="./photos/car1.jpg"/>
    <!-- <img class="imgcar" src="./photos/car3.jpg"/>-->
    </div>
    <!-- <p class="contentp2">1. Lower your expectations for sightseeing. You are not going to walk as much as you could, you are not going to see as much as you could, but at the end of the day you will be as exhausted as possible.
            <br>
            <br>
            2. Prepare that everything will be according to your baby. You will be stopping each few hours or more often. If you want to have lunch, but your baby will be sleeping you will not stop. Take snacks for yourself (a lot of).
            <br>
            <br>
            3. A lot of entertainment staff: books, toys and anything that makes your baby engaged. The thing that worked best for me were the books. My baby loved and still loves to flip and read books.
            <br>
            <br>
            4. Snacks if your baby already eats solids. Many different snacks, some ideas: corn puffs, cheese, berries (if you are not afraid of mess), cookies, pressed purees.
            <br>
            <br>
            5. Breastfeeding. It really helps to calm down and to make the baby fall asleep.
            <br>
            <br>
            6. Always have wet wipes on hand. Wet wipes are a thing when you are a mom.
            <br>
            <br>
            7. Take a lot of photos, because you (at least I) will enjoy the journey more after it is finished.
            <br>
            <br>
            8. Keep calm. Probably you will be driving somewhere in a developed country. There will be stores, pharmacists and hospitals on the way.
